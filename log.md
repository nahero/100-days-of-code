# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 7: 1. May 2020

**Progress**: Angular HTTP requests + Firebase - error handling and get post attempt - CORS block

**Thoughts:** hello again CORS old friend...

**Link:** [Angular9 - HTTP](https://github.com/nahero/angular9-http)

### Day 6: 30. April 2020

**Progress**: Angular HTTP requests + Firebase - adding types and moving requests to a service

**Thoughts:** Just a follow-up on HTTP requests today

### Day 5: 29. April 2020

**Progress**: Angular HTTP requests + Firebase

**Thoughts:** Firebase does all the job on creating database and providing back-end and main API endpoint, but setting up the requests with proper types and using pipe/operators to modify the data received can be a PITA

### Day 4: 28. April 2020

**Progress**: Angular Pipes - built-in and creating custom pipes

**Thoughts:** Already know pipes from angularjs but went in deeper this time, and creating custom pipes with AngularCLI is a breeze

**Link:** [Angular9 - Pipes](https://github.com/nahero/angular9-pipes)

### Day 3: 27. April 2020

**Progress**: Reactive forms and CRUD using reactive forms

**Thoughts:** Will investigate how to use existing Interface to setup reactive form, whose value should obviously be identical to the Interface (at least in this course)

### Day 2: 25. April 2020

**Progress**: Forms - template driven and reactive forms

**Thoughts:** Rolling along :)

### Day 1: 24. April 2020

**Progress**: Angular observables and Subject + setting up a git repo from local project

**Thoughts:** Re-acquanting with Angular quirks and using new features

**Link:** [Angular9-observables](https://github.com/nahero/angular9-Observables)

### Day 0: 23. April 2020

**Progress**: Back to the big Angular 9 tutorial on Udemy - observables and custom observables

**Thoughts:** Good to be back on Angular after few months developing Wordpress sites :)

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
